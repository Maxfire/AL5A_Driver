AL5A_Driver
===========

This Arduino code receives commands via the Serial port.  The command format is as follows:

servo,angle   (servo is from 0 to 5, angle from 0 to 180)

The other half of this code runs on Processing and is called AL5A_CONTROL.

Parts of this code has been taken from many sources, many of which I have forgotten.  
However, I suspect that the Arduino Cookbook 2nd Edition has had the greatest influence and is a reference which everyone should own.
